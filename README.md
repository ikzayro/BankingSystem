# BankingSystem

To start with, we will first explain a little bit about project and furthermore we will give some information regarding our functions. Also you will be able to see how our linked lists are constructed and operated. Moreover, you will also be able to visually see how the program works. We prepared screenshots which will help you understand the project better by seeing the visuals of outputs etc.

So, in the project we are simulating a banking system. All information such as: information of the branches of the bank, the types of transactions offered  by bank, transactions and the transactions made by the customers are kept using linked lists.
